# Athletic Sales Data Analysis with Pandas



## Purpose
The **Athletic Sales Data Analysis with Pandas** program provides insights into product sales, regional performance, and retailer profitability for a fictional athletic footwear company. This project uses Python's Pandas library to explore and analyze sales data, highlighting key trends and metrics to aid business decision-making.

As a data analyst, I developed this project to enhance my skills in working with large datasets and solving real-world business problems. The project simulates a business scenario, allowing me to apply data transformation, aggregation, and visualization techniques using Python.

## Overview
The **Athletic Sales Data Analysis with Pandas** project addresses key business questions:

- Which regions and retailers generate the highest sales?
- What are the sales trends across product categories and time periods?
- Which products are most profitable, and in which regions?
- How do sales methods vary across retailers?

This project demonstrates the use of Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.
